### 3) [2502.16740v1] I am not thinking anymore, just following the path.: Investigating Task Delegation Trend of Author-AI Co-Creation with Generative AIs
https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16740v1

**Summary:** **Problem:** The paper explores how digital comic authors delegate tasks to generative AIs during the creative process, particularly focusing on the balance between human input and AI assistance.

**Approach:** The authors observed 16 digital comic creators during the drafting stage, categorizing their levels of task delegation to AI. They analyzed the extent of this delegation, variations in AI usage, and how authors adjusted their delegation strategies throughout the co-creation process.

**Key Results:** Findings revealed that most authors significantly delegated tasks to AI, correlating higher delegation with reduced creation time and more detailed queries to AI. However, about 60% of authors later recalibrated their delegation levels, often opting for less reliance on AI due to concerns over losing creative agency and dissatisfaction with AI's originality.

**Why It Matters:** This study highlights the evolving dynamics of human-AI collaboration in creative fields, offering insights into effective task delegation strategies. It emphasizes the need to redefine trust in co-creation and proposes new metrics for assessing trust in human-AI interactions, which can inform future practices in creative industries.
