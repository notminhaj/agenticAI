{"title": "[2502.16740v1] I am not thinking anymore, just following the path.: Investigating Task Delegation Trend of Author-AI Co-Creation with Generative AIs", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16740v1", "summary": "**Problem:** This paper explores how digital comic authors delegate creative tasks to generative AIs during the drafting process, focusing on the implications of this delegation on creativity and authorship.\n\n**Approach:** The researchers observed 16 digital comic authors, categorizing their levels of delegation to AIs and analyzing variations in AI usage and how authors recalibrated their delegation after co-creation.\n\n**Key Results:** Findings indicate that most authors significantly delegate tasks to AIs, which correlates with reduced creation time. Approximately 60% of authors adjusted their delegation levels post-creation, often reducing delegation due to feelings of lost agency and AI-generated outputs lacking originality.\n\n**Why It Matters:** The study provides vital insights into author-AI collaboration, suggesting strategies for effective task delegation and redefining trust in human-AI co-creation. This understanding is crucial for balancing creativity and reliance on AI in artistic processes.", "tokens_in": 1134, "tokens_out": 180}
