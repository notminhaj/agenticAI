### 2) [2507.11764v1] AI Wizards at CheckThat! 2025: Enhancing Transformer-Based Embeddings with Sentiment for Subjectivity Detection in News Articles
https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11764v1

**Problem:** The paper addresses the challenge of classifying sentences in news articles as subjective or objective, particularly focusing on monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot scenarios across various languages, including unseen ones.

**Approach:** The authors enhance transformer-based models by integrating sentiment scores into sentence representations, going beyond standard fine-tuning methods. They utilized mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base, and Llama3.2-1B, while optimizing decision threshold calibration to tackle class imbalance.

**Key Results:** The integration of sentiment features significantly improved performance, particularly in the subjective F1 score. The approach achieved notable rankings, including 1st place for the Greek language with a Macro F1 score of 0.51.

**Why It Matters:** This research contributes to better subjectivity detection in news articles, enhancing the interpretability of AI models across multiple languages. The findings highlight the importance of sentiment analysis in improving classification tasks, with implications for information retrieval and natural language understanding.
