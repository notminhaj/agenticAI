{"title": "[2502.16740v1] I am not thinking anymore, just following the path.: Investigating Task Delegation Trend of Author-AI Co-Creation with Generative AIs", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16740v1", "summary": "**Problem:** The paper investigates how digital comic authors delegate tasks to generative AIs during the creation process, particularly focusing on the effects of this delegation on the authors' creative agency and output.\n\n**Approach:** The authors observed 16 digital comic creators using generative AIs in their drafting stages. They categorized the levels of task delegation and analyzed the variations in AI usage, the extent of delegation, and how authors adjusted their use of AI after the co-creation process.\n\n**Key Results:** The study found that most authors delegated significant tasks to the AI, which correlated with reduced time spent on creation and more specific queries directed at the AI. Post-co-creation, about 60% of authors recalibrated their delegation levels, often opting for less delegation due to concerns over diminished agency and the AI's lack of originality.\n\n**Why It Matters:** This research sheds light on the evolving dynamics of human-AI collaboration in creative fields, offering strategies for authors to balance task delegation and maintain creative control. It also proposes new metrics for assessing trust in human-AI co-creation, enhancing understanding of collaborative processes in digital content creation.", "tokens_in": 1139, "tokens_out": 228}
