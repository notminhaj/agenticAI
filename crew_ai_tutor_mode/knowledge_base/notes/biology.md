Biology is the study of living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, and interaction with their environment. It covers a wide range of topics like cell biology, genetics, ecology, and physiology.


Recent biology news highlights from 2025 include: Bird flu virus has a heat-resistant gene allowing replication at fever temperatures; photosynthetic bacteria can absorb toxic PFAS chemicals; ribosomes send stress signals when collided; engineered CRISPR wheat promotes natural nitrogen fixation; live-cell imaging allows scientists to watch DNA damage and repair dynamically; fossil and animal behavior discoveries such as an ancient crocodile relative, dinosaur mummy, hidden wolf DNA in dogs, and bacteria mimicking octopus camouflage. Other highlights include chimps consuming alcohol naturally and AI uncovering a hidden lion roar. These show biology's fast-paced progress across scales.
