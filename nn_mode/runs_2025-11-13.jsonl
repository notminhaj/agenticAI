{"title": "Quantum mechanics from invariance principles", "summary": "**Problem:** Quantum mechanics, despite its success, lacks an intuitive axiomatization similar to that of the special theory of relativity, making it challenging to understand its foundational principles.\n\n**Approach:** The paper presents an axiomatic framework for quantum mechanics based on invariance principles. Key assumptions include invariance under time evolution, tensor composition, and relational laws, culminating in a Jordan-Lie algebraic formulation.\n\n**Key Results:** The framework establishes that quantum mechanics is characterized by an additional postulate: the violation of Bell inequalities, which distinguishes it from classical theories. This provides a more coherent structure to understand quantum phenomena.\n\n**Why It Matters:** By offering a clear axiomatization akin to relativity, this approach enhances the understanding of quantum mechanics, potentially bridging gaps in its foundational interpretation and fostering further research in both quantum physics and related fields.", "tokens_in": 1108, "tokens_out": 169, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3935v3", "score": 0.8408002853393555}
