**Problem:** As AI agents increasingly perform complex tasks in workflows, their interactions can lead to errors, including hallucinations. Current provenance methods fail to effectively track the intricate metadata associated with these agents, making it difficult to ensure transparency and reliability.

**Approach:** The paper introduces PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that enhances W3C PROV standards by integrating agent interactions into comprehensive workflow provenance using the Model Context Protocol and data observability. It includes an open-source system for real-time provenance capture.

**Key Results:** PROV-AGENT supports critical provenance queries and assesses agent reliability across various environments, including edge, cloud, and HPC. The system has been successfully evaluated to demonstrate its practical applicability in tracking agent interactions.

**Why It Matters:** By providing a unified model for tracking AI agent interactions, PROV-AGENT enhances the transparency and reliability of AI systems, mitigating risks associated with errors in agentic workflows. This advancement is crucial for developing trustworthy AI applications in diverse fields.
