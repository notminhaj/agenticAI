There is a need for an interdisciplinary framework to bridge these conceptual gaps.\n\nApproach:\n- Proposes a novel framework called AI Thinking that models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. It identifies five practice-based competencies: motivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts in which it is used. A hypothetical case study illustrates the framework in action.\n\nResults:\n- A conceptual framework intended to unify diverse understandings of AI in practice and to guide AI literacy and AI-driven innovation.\n\nSignificance:\n- Aims to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse AI contexts, helping reshape the future of AI use in practice.", "tokens_in": 1200, "tokens_out": 350}
{"title": "Intersymbolic AI: Interlinking Symbolic AI and Subsymbolic AI", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11563v3", "summary": "### Intersymbolic AI — Summary\n\nProblem:\n- There is a long-standing gap between symbolic AI (logic, planning, and meaningful symbolic representations) and subsymbolic AI (learning-based approaches). A unifying field is needed to leverage strengths from both paradigms.\n\nApproach:\n- Introduces the concept of Intersymbolic AI, which interlinks symbolic AI with subsymbolic AI to enable culminations of insights by moving between symbolic reasoning and subsymbolic learning. Canonical symbolic approaches (logic, games, planning) are bridged with canonical subsymbolic approaches (unsupervised, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning).\n- Describes how alternating between symbolic insights and subsymbolic learning can improve understanding and control of AI systems in practice.\n\nResults:\n- A perspective piece surveying existing contributions and outlining possible future directions for interlinking the two paradigms.\n\nSignificance:\n- Promises better interpretability, robustness, and generalization by combining the meaning and compositionality of symbolic AI with the data-driven power of subsymbolic AI.", "tokens_in": 1100, "tokens_out": 360}
