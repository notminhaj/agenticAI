# cool applications of AI agents

AI agents come in many types with diverse uses: Customer support chatbots answering FAQs and processing refunds; lead generation/chatbots qualifying leads; utility-based agents trading stocks, dynamically pricing (e.g., surge pricing in ride sharing), and recommending content (e.g., Netflix). Goal-based agents perform tasks like Roomba's cleaning or strategizing in video games. Model-based reflex agents power self-driving cars and smart irrigation. Learning agents adapt like fraud detection or speech recognition improving over time. Hierarchical agents organize manufacturing lines and air traffic control. Robotic agents operate in physical tasks like assembly lines and surgical assistance. Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant process natural language to help users. Multi-agent systems optimize traffic, energy grids, and supply chains via collaboration. Simple reflex agents run thermostats, automatic doors, smoke detectors, and basic spam filtering.
