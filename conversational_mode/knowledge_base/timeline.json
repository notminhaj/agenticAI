    "old_value": "Agentic RAG refers to using Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques within agentic AI systems, where autonomous agents leverage retrieval over knowledge bases or documents to generate context-aware, grounded responses or actions. Recent trends include improving retrieval relevance with better embedding models, dynamic retrieval policies, and integrating retrieval with agent planning and tool-use. Although no exact new papers titled 'agentic RAG' appeared recently, advances in RAG techniques, such as open-domain QA with retrieval, multi-hop reasoning with retrieval, and better memory retrieval for autonomous agents, are the core foundation. Combined with agentic AI progress\u2014focused on autonomous decision-making and self-improving agents\u2014agentic RAG is evolving to support more robust, interpretable, and context-aware agent behaviors.",
    "new_value": "Agentic RAG is an advancement over traditional RAG systems that incorporates AI agents to increase adaptability, accuracy, scalability, and flexibility. It allows LLMs to retrieve information from multiple external knowledge bases and use tool calls for complex workflows. Characteristics include memory for planning, query routing, multiagent collaboration frameworks like ReAct and plan-and-execute. Benefits include multi-source retrieval, adaptive step-by-step reasoning, and improved accuracy via iterative optimization. Downsides include higher compute costs, increased latency, complexity of collaboration and partial unreliability of agents. Use cases include real-time Q&A, automated support escalation, and data management across proprietary data lakes.
