Aerospace engineering is the branch of engineering that focuses on designing, developing, testing, and producing aircraft, spacecraft, and related systems and equipment. It covers two major areas: aeronautical engineering (aircraft within Earth's atmosphere) and astronautical engineering (spacecraft beyond the atmosphere). Key concepts include aerodynamics, propulsion, avionics, materials science, structural analysis, and control systems. Aerospace engineers work on everything from commercial airplanes and military jets to satellites and space exploration vehicles.
