# self-improving agents

Self-improving agents are AI programs that get better at their tasks over time. For beginners, imagine a digital helper that learns from its mistakes and improves day by day.

Self-improving agents are AI systems designed to autonomously enhance their own performance by learning from experiences, adapting to new environments, and optimizing behavior without human intervention. Understanding these agents helps grasp future capabilities and challenges in agentic AI development.
