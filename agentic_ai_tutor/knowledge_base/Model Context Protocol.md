### Latest on Model Context Protocol (MCP) as of September 2025

MCP is an open-source standard designed to connect AI applications (like ChatGPT or Claude) to external data sources, tools, and workflows. Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI — it standardizes how AI apps interface with outside systems to gain access to files, databases, calculators, search engines, or specialized prompts.

What MCP enables:
- Agents accessing and interacting with your Google Calendar, Notion, or organizational databases.
- AI generating web apps from Figma designs.
- Enterprise chatbots connecting across multiple databases for advanced data analysis.
- AI models creating 3D designs and printing them using connected devices.

Why it matters:
- Developers save time integrating AI apps with external systems.
- AI applications become more capable through enhanced access to data and tools.
- End-users get better AI assistants that can perform actions on their behalf.

This latest update reinforces MCP's role as a universal, extensible interface for AI systems, fostering more personalized, powerful AI experiences across domains.
