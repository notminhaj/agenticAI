**Problem:**  
Reactive systems often face unexpected failures during runtime, requiring dynamic self-healing to maintain reliability. Traditional recovery methods lack adaptability and fail to optimize recovery actions in complex, changing environments.

**Approach:**  
The study proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables reactive systems to learn effective recovery strategies dynamically. The RL agent interacts with the environment to identify and execute optimal recovery actions under varying failure conditions.

**Key Results:**  
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the RL-based approach outperforms static recovery policies, achieving faster and more effective system recovery. The method adapts to diverse failure scenarios, improving system resilience and reducing downtime.

**Why It Matters:**  
This approach advances autonomous system reliability by enabling adaptive, data-driven recovery. It reduces maintenance costs and increases uptime, crucial for critical reactive systems in domains like robotics, IoT, and real-time control.
