      "notes": "Agentic AI consists of autonomous AI agents capable of performing complex, goal-driven tasks with limited human oversight. Key features include multiagent coordination, proactive tool use, adaptability, and intuitive natural language interfaces. Advantages include autonomy, proactivity, specialization, adaptability, and human-like interaction. Real-world examples span finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, and supply chain. Challenges include risks from poorly designed reward functions, unintended behaviors, bottlenecks in multiagent systems, and failures cascading through agent teams. This info is based on a 2-day-old IBM article giving a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview of Agentic AI and its emerging applications.",

      "notes": "Researchers are embedding autonomous AI agents into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines to enhance adaptability, scalability, and context awareness. They focus on dynamic retrieval strategy management, iterative refinement of context, multiagent collaboration, and tool use for complex workflows. Applications span healthcare, finance, and education. Challenges include scaling, ethical decision-making, and performance optimization. Recent surveys provide taxonomies of architectures, practical implementation strategies, and highlight the integration of agentic design patterns such as reflection, planning, and collaboration frameworks. This knowledge was updated based on a comprehensive 2025 survey paper on Agentic RAG.",
