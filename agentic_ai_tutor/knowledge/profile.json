      "notes": "Recent research highlights that despite remarkable performance on language tasks, LLMs still struggle with basic character composition understanding, failing simple tasks humans ace. Additionally, benchmarks for LLM causal reasoning often rely on domain knowledge retrieval, questioning their validity. New work proposes criteria for better causal reasoning benchmarks incorporating true interventional and counterfactual reasoning. This signals ongoing challenges in foundational and higher-level reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",
