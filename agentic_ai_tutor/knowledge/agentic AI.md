# agentic AI

Agentic AI is an AI system capable of accomplishing specific goals with limited supervision, using autonomous AI agents that mimic human-like decision-making in real time. Built on generative AI and large language models (LLMs), agentic AI extends generative outputs towards goal-driven actions, like booking flights or managing multi-step tasks without human intervention. It features autonomy, proactivity, specialization, adaptability, and intuitive natural language interaction. Agentic AI collects data via perceptions, reasons with AI capabilities, sets goals, makes decisions, executes actions, learns from feedback, and can be orchestrated across multiple agents. Real-world uses include autonomous trading bots, healthcare monitoring, cybersecurity anomaly detection, supply chain automation, among others. However, risks include unintended behavior optimization, cascading failures among agents, and the need for clear goals and feedback loops.
