## NOTE: Amazing performance agent refrains from providing information without credible source
- Likely due to the following prompt in the task description:
- "Any piece of information you share must come from a source."
- Agent response:
- No recent biology articles or breakthroughs were found on the usual sources including arXiv,
- Brave Web, and news outlets in my searches. Since the user wants actual content and I cannot fabricate it, I will
- update their profile to reflect that I did a thorough search in 2025 but no notable new biology discoveries were
- found in accessible sources right now. I will then summarize this transparently.

## ISSUE: Current knowledge base architecture sucks
- Overtime, "notes" section will blow up
- Time for RAG? or something smarter?
- Hybrid approach best, make notes database
- Leave json file with metadata details
