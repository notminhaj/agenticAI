### 3) [2502.16740v1] I am not thinking anymore, just following the path.: Investigating Task Delegation Trend of Author-AI Co-Creation with Generative AIs
https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16740v1

**Problem:** The paper explores how digital comic authors delegate tasks to generative AIs during the creation process, focusing on the extent of this delegation and its effects on authors' creative agency.

**Approach:** Researchers observed 16 digital comic authors during the drafting stage, categorizing their levels of task delegation to AIs. They analyzed the variations in AI usage and how authors adjusted their delegation over time.

**Key Results:** Most authors significantly delegated tasks to AI, which correlated with reduced creation time and more detailed queries to the AI. Post-creation, about 60% of authors recalibrated their delegation levels, often opting for less delegation due to concerns over agency and AI originality.

**Why It Matters:** The findings offer insights into effective author-AI collaboration, suggesting strategies for balancing task delegation and redefining trust in co-creation. This research has implications for enhancing creative processes and understanding human-AI interactions in artistic domains.
